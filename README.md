# Overview

I made a choose your own adventure game in C#!

It uses classes and inheritence. 
The main functions are switch case loops, with if statements nested inside. Text and display are done by the class Story, which inherits from class GameLogic.


I wrote this project to learn C# and apply what I learned in a fun project.
